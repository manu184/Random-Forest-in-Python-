# Random-Forest-in-Python
The problem we will tackle is predicting the max temperature for tomorrow in our city using one year of past weather data.

This is a supervised, regression machine learning problem. It’s supervised because we have both the features (data for the city) and the targets (temperature) that we want to predict. During training, we give the random forest both the features and targets and it must learn how to map the data to a prediction. Moreover, this is a regression task because the target value is continuous 

We have our question: “can we predict the max temperature tomorrow for our city?”
